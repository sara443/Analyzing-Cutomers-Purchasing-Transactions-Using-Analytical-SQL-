Analyzing Cutomers Purchasing Transactions Using Analytical SQL (SQL- Analytical SQL Functions - CTEs - Window Functions)



In this project, we aim to analyze customer purchasing transactions to gain insights into their behavior and optimize various aspects of the business, including sales, revenue, customer retention, and churn.

The problem statement revolves around utilizing analytical SQL to analyze customers' purchasing transactions and derive meaningful insights. The goal is to efficiently target customers, increase sales and revenue, improve customer retention, and reduce churn.

We have two datasets for this analysis:

OnlineRetail: This dataset contains 12,858 rows of retail transactions data. Each row represents a purchase made by a customer and includes information such as the invoice number, stock code, quantity, invoice date, price, customer ID, and country.

DailyCustomers: This dataset comprises 574,396 rows of daily purchasing transactions data for customers. Each row represents a purchase made by a customer and includes information such as the customer ID, purchasing date, and the amount.

By analyzing these datasets using analytical SQL techniques, we can uncover valuable insights into customer behavior. These insights will enable us to effectively target customers, identify patterns in their purchasing habits, optimize sales and revenue, improve customer retention, and reduce churn.

Overall, the objective is to leverage analytical SQL to gain a deeper understanding of customers' purchasing behavior and utilize this knowledge to enhance various aspects of the business.
